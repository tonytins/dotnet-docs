> Package manager installs are only supported on the **x64** architecture. Other architectures, such as **ARM**, must install .NET by some other means such as with Snap, an installer script, or through a manual binary installation.

For more information on installing .NET without a package manager, see one of the following articles:

- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with Snap.](../linux-snap.md)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime with a script.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#scripted-install)
- [Install the .NET SDK or the .NET Runtime manually.](../linux-scripted-manual.md#manual-install)
